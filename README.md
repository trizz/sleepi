Raspberry Pi scripts for controlling an interactive RGB LED bar in the bedroom. By using a PIR sensor it detects movement
and it lights up a RGB ledstrip with the brightness adjusted depending on the time of day (or night) (not ready yet...).
This way you can see where you're walking whithout the need to turn on the lights (and waking your other half).

### Other (possible) future features:
- A webinterface controlling the state of the RGB ledstrip
    - Different types of "programs" to create lighting effects
    - Set the ledstrip to a specific colour
- Use the ledstrip as a kind of wake-up light
    - Allow multiple "alarms" (for example only on workdays at 07.00 and in the weekend at 09.00)
    - Including sound (? I don't know this one yet...)
